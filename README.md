Current Weather Display: Upon searching for a city, you are presented with the city name, the current date, an icon representation of the weather conditions, the temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

5-Day Forecast: The dashboard also displays a 5-day forecast for the searched city. Each day shows the date, an icon representation of the weather conditions, the temperature, humidity, and wind speed.
